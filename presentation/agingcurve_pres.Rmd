-   Aging curve: performance throughout a career

-   Ability vs. age

-   Topics to explore: peak, rate of change, shape,... 

```{r, fig.width=3.6, fig.height=2.4, fig.pos="center"}
data.frame(
  Age = 21:39,
  Performance = c(25.8, 27.5, 29.8, 31.7, 31.1, 31.2, 31.6, 27.7, 29.7, NA, 22.1, 29.4, 27.8, 25.2, NA, NA, NA, 20.7, 19.3)
) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Performance)) + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +

# Aging Curve in Sports Literature

-   Morris (1983): Used parametric empirical Bayes procedures to estimate Ty Cobb's BA trajectory

-   Albert (1992): Used a Poisson random effects model to smooth the career trajectory of a batter's HR rates.

-   Albert (1999): Used a quadratic aging function to compare the best home run hitters.

-   Berry et. al. (1999): Compared abilities of athletes from different eras in baseball, hockey, and golf.

-   Schall and Smith (2000): Investigated baseball hitters and pitchers performance during the course of their careers. Used logit model to predict survival probabilities of players.

# Player drop-out as a missing data problem

-   Missing data: MCAR, MAR, MNAR

-   Where could missingness occur for a player?

    -   Beginning of career 

    -   End of career

---

# Data

-   Lahman database: `http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics`

    -   `Lahman` `R` package

    -   `Batting` and `People` tables

---

\scriptsize

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(Lahman)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE, comment=""}

# Method

-   Fit a model

-   Generate "fake" players careers

-   Create different drop-out mechanisms

-   Impute the data

-   Go back to the real MLB data

---

```{r}
library(lme4)
mixed_mod <- lmer(OPS ~ poly(age, 3, raw = TRUE) + (1|playerID), data = baseball)
```

# Model and Simulation

-   Model: `OPS ~ poly(age, 3) + (1|playerID)`

```{r}
mod1 <- lmer(OPS ~ poly(age, 3, raw = TRUE) + (1|playerID), data = baseball)
randeff <- as.data.frame(VarCorr(mod1))

set.seed(12345)
sim <- function(){
  age <- data.frame(age = 20:40)
  pred <- predict(mixed_mod, age, re.form = NA)
  
  shift <- rnorm(1, 0, randeff[1,5]) # new player- strength, shift
  eps <- rnorm(nrow(age), 0, randeff[2,5]) # variability across szn
  
  career <- pred + shift + eps
  return(career)
}

mylist <- list()
for(i in 1:9){
  mylist[[i]] <- data.frame(player = i, ops = sim(), age = 20:40)
}

do.call(rbind, mylist) %>% 
  mutate(player = as.factor(player)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ops, col = player)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + theme_bw() +  
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```

-   There's a small problem...

---

# A better approach...

-   Use a transformation: arcsin transformation

```{r}
scaled <- baseball %>% 
  filter(OPS < 1.422) %>% 
  select(playerID, age, OPS) %>% 
  mutate(scaledOPS = OPS/max(OPS),
         arcsin = asin(sqrt(scaledOPS)))

maxOPS <- max(scaled$OPS)

mixed_mod <- lmer(arcsin ~ poly(age, 3, raw = TRUE) + (1|playerID), data = scaled)
randeff <- as.data.frame(VarCorr(mixed_mod))

set.seed(123)
sim <- function(){
  age <- data.frame(age = 20:40)
  pred <- predict(mixed_mod, age, re.form = NA)
  
  shift <- rnorm(1, 0, randeff[1,5]) # new player- strength, shift
  eps <- rnorm(nrow(age), 0, randeff[2,5]) # variability across szn
  
  career <- pred + shift + eps
  return(career)
}


mylist <- list()
for(i in 1:1000){
  mylist[[i]] <- data.frame(player = i, arcsin = sim(), age = 20:40)
}

simdata <- do.call(rbind, mylist)

simdata <- mutate(simdata, ops = round(maxOPS*sin(arcsin)^2, 5))


simdata[1:189,] %>% 
  mutate(player = as.factor(player)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = ops, col = player)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_smooth(se = FALSE) + theme_bw() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=7))
```

# Drop-out rules

-   If a player is 35 and his OPS is below a given threshold, he retires

-   If a player is 25 and OPS is below a given threshold, then drop (i.e. player is not good enough to remain in the league)

-   Drop players at the start of their careers due to low performance, but allow them to come back.

-   At ages 30 and 35, 25% and 35% of players randomly retire.

# # middle of career
